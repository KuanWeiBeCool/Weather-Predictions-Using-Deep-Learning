# Weather-Predictions-Using-Deep-Learning

The objective of this homework is to create time-series forecasting models for weather predictions. The data-set used is derived from the weather time-series data by the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry from 2009 to 2016. The original data-set has time steps of 10 minutes but was modified for the purpose of this homework to have time steps of 1 hour.

The produced models will output predicted values for atmospheric pressure, air temperature, relative humidify and wind speed (magnitude of the wind velocity vector). The input features will be weather attributes of the previous *k* time steps. The features will, at the minimum, use the atmospheric pressure, air temperature, relative humidify and wind speed.
